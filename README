mount-image - Easy mounting of ISO (and similar) files, from Nautilus or the shell


INSTALL

git clone https://github.com/l0b0/mount-image.git && mount-image/install.sh

Now you can remove the mount-image directory.


RUN

In Nautilus (the GNOME file manager):
Right-click on an image file, then select "Mount Image File(s)" or "Unmount Image File(s)".

On the shell:
$ mount-image /path/to/some.iso
$ umount-image /path/to/some.iso

Both methods take multiple files - You can
$ mount-image *.{iso,nrg}
or use the script on several selected files in Nautilus.
