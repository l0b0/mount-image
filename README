mount-iso - Easy mounting of ISO (and similar) files, from Nautilus or the shell

This has been tested with ISO and NRG files.


INSTALL

git clone https://github.com/l0b0/mount-image.git && sudo mount-image/install.sh

Now you can remove the mount-image directory.


RUN

In Nautilus (the GNOME file manager):
Right-click an image file, select "Scripts", and then "mount-image" or "unmount-image".

On the shell:
$ mount-image /path/to/some.iso
$ umount-image /path/to/some.iso

Both methods take multiple files - You can
$ mount-image *.{iso,nrg}
and use the script on selected files in Nautilus.
